# General Formatting Rules

- Always add a new line at the end of each file
- Use **single quotes** for strings in JavaScript and TypeScript files
- Use **double quotes** for strings on the backend (including test files and factories)
- Use **2 spaces** for indentation in all code files

- Avoid shortening variable names; prefer clear, descriptive names (e.g. `user` instead of `usr`).
- Prefer descriptive names for methods, functions, and variables instead of adding comments to explain them.
- If a method or function becomes large or requires explanatory comments, split it into smaller pieces to keep code readable.
